# Digital Pet Life Log

This is a virtual pet management application built with Vue.js. Users can customize each pet's emoji avatar and background color, and manage their health, mood, and energy levels. Pets can be added, edited, or deleted. Users can interact with pets through buttons like “Feed,” “Play,” and “Sleep.” All data is automatically stored in Firebase Firestore.

## Design Concept

I used Vue’s computed properties and Bootstrap’s grid system to separate data logic from visual layout, improving code readability and maintainability. Firebase Firestore ensures data is both persistent and reactive in real time.

## Reflection

The most challenging and interesting part of development was designing the avatar system—combining emoji and color to give each pet a unique personality.

This project helped me deepen my understanding of Vue’s reactivity system, Firestore’s data modeling, and how to use technology to create engaging interactive experiences. I now better understand the idea that “data is a system”—not just something to display, but something that responds and evolves with user input.
